A Conceptual Data Model is a diagram identifying the business concepts (entities) and 
the relationships between these concepts in order to gain, reflect, and document understanding 
of the organization’s business, from a data perspective.

“It shows how the business world sees information. It suppresses non-critical details in order 
to emphasize business rules and user objects. It typically includes only significant entities which have
business meaning, along with their relationships.”

A Conceptual Data Model usually takes the form of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or Object Role Model (ORM). 
The Conceptual Data Model typically does not contain attributes, or if it does only significant attributes.

The Conceptual Data Model should reflect relationships from a historical, longitudinal perspective.

For example, a relationship between Store and Employee may usually be considered a one-to-many, but when viewed from a historical perspective perhaps the relationship may actually be many-to-many – what if the Employee begins work at another Store?

In addition, Conceptual Data Models should reflect both as-is and to-be in the same model. To-be here does not mean what the data entities/relationships will be in the solution to be developed; rather, to-be here represents changes to the business that are currently in the works, or are considered highly probable.

A caution is to make sure that the distinction is clearly made on the model when an entity or relationship is “to-be” – perhaps use a different color for this. Capturing “to be” entities/relationships allows for the possibility of designing in flexibility (within reason) into your solution.
